/*
* This code is to test if the ultrasonic sensors are working
* as expected.
* In our robot, we have three ultrasonic sensors, one on the
* front, and one each on left and right side of the robot.
* The ultrasonic sensors have to detect if there is a wall
* present at respective side of the robot.
* current setting of the robot as of 14 Apr 2018:
*   Chassis dimensions: 13 cm x 15 cm
*   Expected single block dimensions of maze: 25 cm x 25 cm
* So, if we place the robot at the centre of the centre of 
* the block, we need the clearance of 6 cm each on left &
* right side, and 6 cm clearance on the front.
